    <div id="bodycontent"><p id="bodyparagraph"><b>Hello again, fellow internet user!</b> If you're anything like millions of other internet users, you probably recognize
the internet as one of the most significant technological developments of our generation. You've probably spent 
countless hours browsing though the billions of interesting sites, assimilating information from the vast wealth 
stored in the nearly-magical entity which is the internet. In the past few hours, it's more than likely that
you've checked your email, posted to a social networking site, watched an internet video, or done any of 
the countless things which can be done here on the web. The internet is an ever-growing collection of websites,
many of which are either useful or entertaining or both. Many of us depend on these websites for education or work.
It's a brilliant system designed by talented engineers to help people accomplish whatever tasks they have,
whether it be research, transcontinental communication, or just mindless entertainment. The reason the internet
is so great can be attributed to the rules which govern it, one of which is known as net neutrality. Essentially,
net neutrality means that all data is treated equally. This ensures that internet service providers(ISPs), the people
who connect you to the internet, cannot discriminate against certain types of data. However, net neutrality,
and the internet as we know it, are at risk of coming to an end.
<br>
You see, ISPs want to ditch this rule to their benefit and your detriment. If net neutrality were removed, ISPs
could place themselves between you and the internet, essentially becoming excessively controlling middlemen. What this
means is that ISPs would have the power to discriminate against certain kinds of data. Their incentive to do this
is to save money by slowing down the stream of data and charging users extra in exchange for faster internet.
If we were to compare the internet to an electric company, this would be the equivalent of an electric company
producing less electricity, forcing everyone to use less energy (and saving the company money in the process),
then charging extra for additional amounts of energy. Under current regulations, this would be impossible for the 
energy company to do, which is fortunate for most consumers. Under the current system, watts are watts and the
energy companies care not what you do with them once they're yours. If you're like the millions of other internet 
users, you probably think this sounds ridiculous. Why would anyone settle for slower internet and pay more for speeds 
which are only comparable to what you had before? The reason people are considering letting the ISPs get away with this
is because of how the ISPs frame their arguments.

You may have heard your internet service provider on the news recently, talking about their plans to build an internet
"fast lanes." These are the main selling point for the removal of net neutrality. This makes it sound like the ISPs
are giving people faster access to the information superhighway, but in reality, these "fast lanes" would only be favoring
specific sites and services. If net neutrality were successfully removed, ISPs could speed up all traffic to their particular
services and put "speed bumps" on competitor's sites. Here's another analogy to illustrate this concept: Imagine a town
in which one department store is given control of the roads in that town. That department store is then free to construct
better roads leading to and from the store, and neglect the roads leading to other competitor stores. This inevitably
makes business better for that particular department store. If an internet service provider disliked a particular 
video streaming site, for example, then they'd have the power to make that site slow to the point where it's unusable.
ISPs also have motivation to reduce internet traffic to specific sites because ISPs also frequently sell other services,
like cable television and landlines. Websites which can potentially replace these services are at risk of becoming
too slow to use.
<br>
Another promise people are considering getting rid of net neutrality is because of the idea of deregulation. ISPs are
claiming that the internet is too highly regulated and that deregulation would permit them to build the aforementioned
"fast lanes." This appeals to individuals and legislators who are in favor of industry deregulation. By claiming that
deregulating the internet will allow them to speed up internet service, they attract the multitudes of customers who
simply want faster internet. They also gain the votes of legislators who will support the abolishing of net neutrality.
What they don't tell customers, however, is what's really important. 
<br>
ISPs are not mentioning that true free use of the internet will cost significantly more than what it already does.
ISPs aren't telling customers that they'll need to pay to use some of their favurite sites. ISPs aren't telling
customers that small business websites won't be able to stay competitive. ISPs aren't telling customers that their 
freedom to use whatever sites they want is at risk of being compromised.
<br>
If you, like thousands of others, want to keep the internet both free and equal, consider taking a moment to 
tell the the following to the Federal Communications Commission: 

"reclassify broadband internet as a title II common carrier telecommunications service"

Thank you for your consideration.
