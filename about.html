    <div id="bodycontent"><p id="bodyparagraph">This website is designed to explain and promote the concept of net neutrality. The internet is perhaps one of the 
most significant advances in technology of our era, and we, the creators of this website, feel obligated to 
support net neutrality and inform other internet users. As students at an internet-based charter school,
the internet is a central facet of our lives, and we know it is the same way for millions of others. Every day,
we rely on the internet for our education, making it imperative that the internet remain neutral and data be
treated equally. As such, we are compelled to protect the internet as it is.
